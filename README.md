# Libft - school 42 project

My implementation of some of the Standard C Library functions including some additional ones.

### What is libft?
**Libft** is an individual project at 42 that requires us to re-create some standard C library functions including some additional ones that can be used later to build a library of useful functions for the rest of the program.

### How does it work?

The goal is to create a library called libft.a from the source files so I can later use that library from other projects at 42.

### How to test?
    make test && ./tester
